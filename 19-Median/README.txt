A map is similar to an array; the user can insert things into a slot, and retrieve them using its key, with a max of 1 key per thing. Meanwhile, a set is somewhat like a grocery list. While you can insert values, you cant retrieve them; you can only check if they are there. Furthermore, there cannot be repeated values, and there can only be a max of one value per key.
