Get the value at the middle of the sorted array and compare it with the value you are searching for. If this value is greater than what you are searching for, get the middle value of the side with smaller values; if the value is greater, get the middle value of the side with the bigger values. Then compare this value with the value you are searching for and repeat until you find it.
